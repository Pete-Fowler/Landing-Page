The goal of this exercise was to replicate a mock image of a web page from The Odin Project, building the HTML and CSS from scratch. In this project, I gained layout experience with nested flexboxes and the resulting intricacies of positioning and alignment. The top header / hero section was the most challenging. 

I practiced visualizing the overall structure as to how the flexboxes would be nested and whether to try and align content at the top in subsequent horizontal boxes or to use columns to add structure within a larger horizontal. I improved my use of browser developer tools to more clearly visualize the flexboxes and what needed to happen. I also gained familiarity with the relevant CSS attributes for alignment and sizing.
