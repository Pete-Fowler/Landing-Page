# Landing-Page

In this project I gained layout experience with nested flexboxes and the resulting intricacies of positioning and alignment. The top header / hero section was the most challenging. 

As my second website layout of any complexity, I struggled with visualizing the overall structure as to how the flexboxes would be nested and whether to try and align content in subsequent horizontal boxes or to use columns to add structure within a larger horizontal. As time went on, I made better use of browser devtools to more clearly visualize the flexboxes and what needed to happen. I also gained some familiarity with the relevant css attributes for alignment and sizing.
