The goal of this exercise was to look at an image of a web page layout created by the Odin Project, and replicate it building the html and css from scratch. In this project I gained layout experience with nested flexboxes and the resulting intricacies of positioning and alignment. The top header / hero section was the most challenging. 

As my second website layout of any complexity, I struggled with visualizing the overall structure as to how the flexboxes would be nested and whether to try and align content at the top in subsequent horizontal boxes or to use columns to add structure within a larger horizontal. As time went on, I made better use of browser developer tools to more clearly visualize the flexboxes and what needed to happen. I also gained familiarity with the relevant css attributes for alignment and sizing.
